=head1 NAME

 Bio::EnsEMBL::Production::Pipeline::TSV::DumpFileMetadata;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The main workhorse of the Metadata dumping pipeline. So far the only metadata
file being dumped is a tab delimited file containing primary assembly chromosome
names and their size, sorted in karyotype order.

The script is responsible for creating the filenames of these target
files, taking data from the database and the formatting of metadata files.

Currently the only metadata file created is a list of karyotypes of an species,
if it exists along with the chromosome size.

Allowed parameters are:

=item species - The species to dump

=item release - A required parameter for the version of Ensembl we are dumping for

=item base_path - The base of the dumps

Bio::EnsEMBL::Production::Pipeline::GeneNameDescProjection::SourceFactory;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For the given array of projection configs, flow the species parameters,
to be processed up by a SpeciesFactory module. Run sequentially,
in the given order, by recursively flowing, removing one config
from the hash each time.
